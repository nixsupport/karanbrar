description: This solution consolidates the build agents required for Azure DevOps Build and Release pipelines. Agents run inside EKS with docker installed in order to communicate with ECR. Build Agents running in EKS have docker container running as a side-car in same pod so that instead of mounting EKS host volume for docker client, it is actually referred to side container over TCP.
